# Heap and Stack Memory

When a program runs, memory is allocated to store variables and temporary data. Two main memory areas are commonly used: heap and stack.

## Stack Memory

Stack memory is a region that stores local variables and information related to the functions currently executing. Each function has its own stack frame, containing parameters, return address, and local variables. Memory allocation and deallocation on the stack are done automatically as functions are called and return.

Operations on the stack follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) model, where the last item added is the first to be removed. This makes the stack efficient for managing function execution but comes with a limited capacity.

## Heap Memory

Heap memory is a dynamic memory area used to allocate memory during program execution. Memory allocation and deallocation on the heap are controlled explicitly by the programmer. This allows the creation of flexible data structures and efficient memory management as needed.

Unlike the stack, the heap does not have a specific organizational structure, and memory allocation can occur sporadically. It is the programmer's responsibility to free allocated heap memory when it is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.

## Conclusion

In summary, stack memory is used to store temporary data and function-related information, with automatic allocation and deallocation. On the other hand, heap memory enables dynamic memory allocation, providing more control to the programmer but requiring responsible memory management.

Both memory areas play vital roles in program operation, and a proper understanding of them is crucial for efficient and bug-free development.
