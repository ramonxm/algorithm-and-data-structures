# Big O Notation

## Definition

Mathematical notation describing algorithm complexity:
- Time complexity
- Space complexity

## Common Complexities

- O(1): Constant time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(nÂ²): Quadratic time

## Analysis Rules

1. Worst-case scenario
2. Remove constants
3. Different terms for different inputs
4. Drop non-dominant terms
